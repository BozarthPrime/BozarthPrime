# Hello, I'm Joseph (he/him/his)
_*Professional software engineer, amatrue musician and maker*_

I am currently a Staff Software Engineer doing DevSecOps work for [Code42](code42.com), building highly performant and resilliant cloud-based cyber security software and infrastructure. I used to work in the healthcare industry building software to help health plans correct incorrect prescription rejections and detect prescription fraud.

In my "free time" I have been serving as a member of the board of directors and 3D Lab manager at [Twin Cities Maker](tcmaker.org), a local 501c3 non-profit [makerspace](https://www.makerspaces.com/what-is-a-makerspace/). I collect new hobbies as my hobby so it is a good fit ðŸ˜„
